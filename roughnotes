var app = angular.module('store', []);
//in the array you write dependencies. 
save this in app.js file. and mention in html tag ng-app="store"

as soon as you include ng-app directive in html, within this html tag you can now have dynamic expressions. 
{{ 4 + 6}} math summation
{{ "hello" + " you" }} 
check angular docs on expressions. 


---------
controlers are where we define our apps behaviour by defining functions and values.
also wrapping the app defiinition in a closure

(function() {
  var app = angular.module('store', []);

    app.controller('StoreController', function(){
    // secind variable is an anonymous function
    this.product = gem; 
    //defining the variable to get access to it within controller

});


var gem = {
    name: 'Dodecahedron',
    price: 2.5,
    description: '. . .',
  }

})();



in html use directive ng-controller to a div where you want the controller, its funcitons and values to be available. 

<div ng-controller="StoreController as store">
  <h1> {{ store.product.name}} </h1>
</div>
